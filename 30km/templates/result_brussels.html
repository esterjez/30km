        <p class="section-text">
          The general 30 km/h speed limit in Brussels was part of a major transformation of urban mobility. The city sought to address structural problems related to street space in favor of sustainable mobility.

            2. Lower noise levels <br>
            3. Support alternative transport

        <strong>30 km/h urban zone as a general rule</strong>. Unlike many cities, where restrictions are introduced in stages or only on individual streets, Brussels has set the 30 km/h limit as a general rule on most streets, leaving exceptions only for the busiest roads. <br><br>
        <strong>Integration with other urban mobility measures </strong>as part of the wider "Good Move" strategy: expansion of the network of bicycle routes, development of public transport. <br><br>
        <strong>Large-scale information campaign</strong>: website, social media, leaflet distribution to letterboxes.

        <strong>Large scale:</strong> Since 1 January 2021, the speed limit of 30 km/h has been the general rule on most streets in Brussels. Exceptions are only the busiest multi-lane roads. <br><br>
        <strong>Adjusting road infrastructure:</strong> New road signs and markings, new speed bumps and pedestrian crossings. <br><br>
        <strong>Information campaign:</strong> City 30 website, advertising on buses and bins, mailing to 600,000 mailboxes, press conferences and social media activity. Due to the extensive media and social media coverage, the project also faced criticism.

    <p class="p2">More Safety</p>
    <p class="p3">
      Since the implementation of the 30 km/h limit, Brussels has seen a consistent decrease in the number of accidents, along with a reduction in the severity of injuries. Vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists benefit most from the lower speeds, which reduce both the likelihood and impact of collisions. Regular speed monitoring at over 80 points across the city has shown improved compliance, making everyday mobility safer and more predictable for all.

    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='icons/transportation.svg') }}" alt="Transportation icon">
    <p class="p2">Lower Noise</p>
    <p class="p3">
      Noise measurements show a reduction of 1.5 to 4.8 dB(A), a change that is significant in terms of human perception. This decrease is equivalent to cutting perceived traffic noise nearly in half in some areas. The result is a calmer, more pleasant soundscape in residential neighborhoods, improving overall quality of life—especially for those living near busy streets or in dense urban environments.

    <p class="p2">Wider Support</p>
    <p class="p3">
      With quieter and safer streets, Brussels has laid the groundwork for a shift toward more walking and cycling. The 30 km/h policy is closely tied to the city's wider "Good Move" mobility plan, which promotes cleaner, more sustainable transport. Residents report feeling safer when moving around their neighborhoods, and urban planners are using these insights to expand cycling infrastructure and public space improvements.
