        <p class="section-text">
         Helsinki's 30 km/h speed limit policy aims to improve road safety and support sustainable transport. It forms part of the city's goal to halve traffic deaths and injuries by 2030 and eliminate them entirely by 2050. By making streets safer, Helsinki also encourages walking, cycling, and public transport over private car use.

      <h2 class="h10-title">From Numbers to Neighbourhoods: Implementation</h2>
      <p class="h10-description">
       <strong>Tailored approach by street type:</strong> Helsinki customized its speed reductions depending on the character of each area. In central neighborhoods like Kallio and Punavuori where walking and cycling dominate and street activity is high, limits were lowered to 30 km/h on most local roads. In more car-oriented or connector roads outside the center, such as sections of Mannerheimintie, limits remained at 40–50 km/h depending on traffic composition and infrastructure. <br><br>
       <strong>Focus on school zones:</strong> Speed limits were dropped to 30 km/h near more than 120 schools and kindergartens. Visual clues like color-coded were deployed to improve driver awareness in these areas. <br><br>
       <strong>Redesign of street geometry in more than 50 areas:</strong> These included raised crosswalks, narrower lanes in residential zones like Käpylä, and curb extensions to slow turning vehicles. <br><br>
       <strong>Integrated cycling and pedestrian upgrades</strong> help to encourage bike commuting while improving safety.

    <p class="p3">
      Between 2016 and 2022, the number of pedestrian and cyclist deaths fell by approximately 75%, contributing to one of the lowest road fatality rates among European capitals. This significant drop shows the long-term effect of sustained speed reduction and prioritizing vulnerable road users.

    <p class="p3">
      Injuries to vulnerable road users fell by almost 30% in areas where lower speed limits were introduced, compared with baseline data from the early 2010s. Slower speeds mean fewer severe collisions and a safer environment for everyone.

    <p class="p3">
      Residents reported feeling significantly safer, particularly families and older citizens. Lower speeds near schools, parks, and shopping streets have made walking and cycling more appealing and accessible in daily life.

      Helsinki integrates speed enforcement with technology: 70 automatic speed control systems are planned, with 33 already in place by the end of 2023. These tools not only increase compliance but also provide valuable data to evaluate and adjust mobility policies over time.
